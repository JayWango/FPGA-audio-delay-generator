# Issue Log:
1. Needed a way to test if the PWM signal to the audio output was working  

## Solution: 
- Modify the constraints (.xdc) file by remapping pin H17 (corresponds to LED 0 on the FPGA board) to the 'audio_pwm_output' signal.
- Remap pin A11 (the actual pwm output signal) to LED 0 temporarily for testing purposes, and to avoid errors when generating bitstream.
- Regenerate the bitstream in Vivado, then change the hardware specification of the platform project in Vitis to the newly generated .xsa file, clean & rebuild platform project, clean & rebuild the application project. 
- Make sure to set the options of the PWM timer (axi_timer_1) for both channels 0 and 1 to have down-counting and auto-reload on. 

*Note:* In order to test the PWM signal, we needed to regenerate a new .xsa file called 'grad_proj_pwm_test.xsa' in the /vivado/ directory. 
To revert back to the proper wiring of the PWM signal to the audio output, we need to clean & rebuild our platform project with the original 'grad_proj_hw_platform.xsa' file.
